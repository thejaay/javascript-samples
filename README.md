Samples for the Deezer Javascript SDK

Full documentation is available on Deezer Developers website: http://developers.deezer.com/sdk/javascript

###  Basic Custom Player
This sample provides a very simple example of a custom Deezer player using the Javascript SDK.
You'll also find sample API requests such as searchings for artists, retrieving an album cover, etc.

### @TODO

- The live song add doesn't work if there is only 1 song in the playlist before adding (because there is no song list displayed)
